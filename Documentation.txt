	We used flask, mongodb, and html templates for our web app. We used google for our oauth and got most of our code to do this from python 
  tutorials. We made html templates for our app to call as the user would go from page to page. Once the user logs in or registers he/she 
  will be directed to our profile page where the user can look up the weather, T times based on T stops, and directions to your destination.
  If the user clicks on weather the user is brought to our weather page that asks for the location you want the weather for. If the user 
  checks on when the next T is the user is directed to a page to insert the wanted T stop and the next two time for that particular T stop 
  will pop up. And for destination it will tell you how long it will take to reach that T stop and what T to take.
