For our technology stack, we decided to use Python Flask. We decided to use this as we were most familiar with using Flask at building web applications and making API calls with this. We were thinking of using Node.js but decided against it as we found that we could build something similar using a more familiar language and system. We also chose Python because of its larger libraries, many advanced APIâ€™s for frontend and backend support, and it is extremely portable. We chose Flask because we wanted more control over which components we wanted to use.
