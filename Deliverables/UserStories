CS411 Assignment 2

1. As a user I would like to enter the first page and be welcomed to a page where I could enter my email and password or 
log in through my google account. Then from there I can log in my coordinates and where I need to go at what time. 
From there I let the web application determine the best route and time to leave and up until I leave it keeps updating. 
Then it can update that into my google calendar so I get a reminder when I need to leave.


2. As a user I should be able to save previous destinations and look through a list of them so that I donâ€™t have to replan 
my route or reenter my destination. This will save time and I will be able to compare previous routes and see which ones I 
like the best.
 
3. As a logged in user I should be able to go into a MyProfile page. From there I should be able to add my house address, 
favorite Bus/T stop, and an entry for each day of the week for the time I need to catch a bus/T. Using this information, 
the app will automatically send notifications each day the user needs to catch a bus/T

4. As a logged in user I should be able to go into a Settings page. From there I can log out or adjust notification sounds.
