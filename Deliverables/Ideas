Ideas for Project

Idea (Darren): Make an app that uses the MBTA API. Each user will create a profile and enter their typical bus/train stop that they take
on a regular basis to get to work/school. They'll input their destination and the latest time they can make it to their
destination.  Also, they'll input their home address so the app can calculate how long it takes to walk to their stop. The app will 
use that profile info to send them a text or notification to let them know when they should leave their house to catch the bus/train 
on time without having to wait for a long time for the bus/train to arrive while making sure they won't miss their bus/train. 
It will identify which bus/train to take to make sure that they get to their destination on time. About an hour before 
they need to start walking, the app will give them an estimated time they'll need to leave and alert them periodically as that
estimation changes with new data. The purpose of the app is to be avoid the rotuine frustration of blindly leaving to catch the bus/train 
and waiting a long time at the stop for the bus/train to arrive. If the API also has the information available, I'd like to display
the probability of a bus/train being full when it arrives at their stop.

Idea 2 : Make a website that uses Imdb, Metacritic, Hulu, or Netflix. A user will create a profile using Facebook or Twitter info. And
then from these people will be able to view what their friends are watching. This is similar to how Spotify shows you what your friends 
are listening to. If you want to allow notifications onto your screen it will notify you when your friend just finished a series or an
episode of a new show. This can help people get recommendations for movies and shows based on people of similar interests to them.
